# Description
Connects to Apple Health and uses data from Apple Watch workouts to summarize a user's weight training routine by split. Still many technical features/UI updates in development, I'll upload more screenshots as I go along! Once I'm really confident in the functionality and the UI, I'll invest in an Apple Developer account and hopefully publish this app (under a different name though, LiftAnalyzer is awful).
