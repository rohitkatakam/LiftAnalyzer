# Description
Connects to Apple Health and uses data from Apple Watch workouts to summarize a user's weight training routine by split and provide benchmarks for future improvement. Uses two machine learning models to predict workout details based on the users personalized previous workout data. One model classifies a user's unlabelled workout based on the stats recorded from the Apple Watch, and another model provides benchmarks to aim for the next workout. The models retrain as the user caputures more workout data, so they start off quite innaccurate and get better over a few weeks of use. Still many technical features/UI updates in development, I'll upload more screenshots as I go along! Once I'm really confident in the functionality and the UI, I'll invest in an Apple Developer account and hopefully publish this app (under a different name though, LiftAnalyzer is awful).
