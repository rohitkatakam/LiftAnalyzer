# Description
Connects to Apple Health and uses data from Apple Watch workouts to summarize a user's weight training routine by split. Uses two machine learning models to predict workout details based on the users personalized previous workout data. The models retrain as the user caputers more data, so they start off quite innacurate and get better over a few months of use. Still many technical features/UI updates in development, I'll upload more screenshots as I go along! Once I'm really confident in the functionality and the UI, I'll invest in an Apple Developer account and hopefully publish this app (under a different name though, LiftAnalyzer is awful).
